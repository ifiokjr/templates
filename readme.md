# templates

> a collection of templates to use for scaffolding your next project

## Why?

I've created a [`scaffold`](https://github.com/ifiokjr/scaffold) package for the purpose of diving into deno. These are a collection of templates I will be using with the scaffold command.

## How?

Follow the installation instructions outlined in the [`scaffold`](https://github.com/ifiokjr/scaffold) repository.

```bash
scaffold ifiokjr/templates/deno <name>
```

## What?

- `deno`: A template for a single package `deno` package.
